<h2>Link 1 and My Checklist Compared</h2>
Comparing Link 1 and my checklist, I noticed we had two different approaches. <br>
Link 1 in my opinion, covers quality code as if the person already knows coding compared to mine. He is very precise, only giving as much detail as needed. <br>
It is written with some examples to help the reader better understand. Which helps new users get an idea of what he is trying to portray. <br>
Compared to mine, he also injected his own opinions and observations. I feel this can lead new users down the wrong path, not knowing if the information is credible. <br>
<br>
Looking at my own checklist I feel that I was too veg and didn't portray what I was trying to say well. Which could confuse the reader.<br>
Link 1 checklist I feel didn't have too much information compared to mine. My checklist contained a lot, which I feel could overwhelm the reader. This could have a negative impact, leading the reader to lose interest.<br>

<h2>Link 2 and My Checklist Compared</h2>
Comparing Link 2 and my checklist. I feel that the information was too simple. <br>
Link 2 covers quality code in a more formal way, expecting the user to check off boxes well looking at their own code.<br>
I feel this approach doesn't teach the user about quality code and expects the user to follow what they say is quality code. Though it might be correct, I believe that the approach to quality code should be situational to the project. <br>
My checklist contains too much information missing the point of a checklist. I think it is missing the checklist component and is more of a read than a checklist.<br>
Even though my checklist had information that wasn't required. This checklist tried to cover everything (For example "Names are spelled correctly"), which is too much and can cause the user to miss the important components. <br>

<h2>Pick out of the Three</h2>
If I was to choose one out of the three. I would choose link 1. Even though I felt that the information was geared more toward someone who knows coding, it was written in a way that was easily understood. <br>
He covered quality code in a way that only showed the important information, leaving out common sense. Examples were given to help users understand and navigate their own code, injecting his opinions so the user could understand his experience.

### Article Summarization Checklist
    - Functional
      - [ ] Does it work
      - [ ] Does it meet the purpose of the program or software
        - The code should reflect the purpose of the intended program or software. It should function without error, which can lead to frustration for the user, causing them to use another service provider.
    - Easy to understand
      - [ ] // Notes so others can understand
      - [ ] Can someone easily navigate your code without confusion
        - Notes allow others working on the project to understand what was done. Easy-to-navigate code allows for changes, improvements, reusability, and portability. 
    - Meets clients' needs
      - [ ] Was testing done
      - [ ] Does the code work and operate as intended for the client
        - Testing ensures that the program or software runs without error but also ensures it meets the client's needs. If it runs to the client's needs, it helps ensure customers continue to use their service and don't seek other venues
    - Secure
      - [ ] Does it run without error
      - [ ] Well documented
        - Errors in the code can lead to serious vulnerabilities in software. These errors allow outside sources to obtain private information which can affect the client and their customers. Well-documented code is a major component of a development process. Not only does it allow others to understand what you did also helps with securing the code
    - Reviews
      - [ ] Have peers review code
        - Having peers review your code helps improve accelerate and stable code
    - Code-checking tool
      - [ ] Used available tools to check code
        - Code-checking tools help improve your code. Running as you code helps improve the quality and keep the code clean
    - Style
      - [ ] Did you use a style guide
      - [ ] Did you use modular coding
        - Style guides help improve the layout of your code. It can be either an existing or a style guide of your own. Code that is modular is clean. When using PHP code, breaking it down into smaller pieces keeps it reusable. This kind of PHP code has a single responsibility and is independent. Using code this way makes it easier to test and maintain. 

### Evaluate my Work
On a scale of 1 to 5, I would give myself a 2. <br>
However, I believe I improved since the last lab. I honestly still have trouble understanding how the instructions are written. Which is affecting my overall progress as I've been an A student in my past classes.<br>
This type of reading learning isn't my strong suit and is a challenge as it is part of my learning ability.<br>
